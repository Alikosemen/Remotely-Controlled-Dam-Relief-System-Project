# Remotely-Controlled-Dam-Relief-System-Project
Water management in dams is very important because our water resources are limited. For this reason, the dam discharge system we developed ensures the safe discharge of water when necessary. The system monitors the water level, gives some warnings, and when it reaches the determined level, automatic evacuation begins, minimizing the risk of floods.
